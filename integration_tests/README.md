Integration Testing Framework
=============

This code builds an image which serves as a framework to run basic integration tests for a language runtime image. It relies on the existence of a sample application which fulfills a spec (detailed below), that will be built and deployed on top of the newly built runtime image. These tests are intended to be run as part of a post-push verification step in a continuous deployment system. The test driver can be run directly via any build host, or as a build step in a [Google Cloud Container Build](https://cloud.google.com/container-builder/docs/overview)).

To run these tests through a cloudbuild, add the following build step to the **end** of your build config (cloudbuild.yaml or cloudbuild.json):

	name: gcr.io/gcp-runtimes/integration_test
	args: [
		'-i', <target_staging_image>,
		'-d', <sample_application_directory>
	]

**It's crucial that this step appears after your image under test has been built**; without a built image, there will be nothing to test, and your build will fail!


The sample application directory should contain the application fulfilling the integration test spec, as well as the necessary build artifacts to deploy the application via gcloud, which means at minimum:

	* a templated Dockerfile, with the first line being
		` FROM ${STAGING_IMAGE} `

	* an app.yaml config

Alternatively, the application can be manually deployed *before* running the tests; in this scenario, the '--no-deploy' flag can be passed to the build step to opt out of deploying, in tandem with the URL at which the deployed application can be accessed:

	args: [
		...,
		'--no-deploy',
		'--url', '<application_url>'
	]

In addition, each test (detailed below) can be skipped by passing the corresponding flag to the build step. For example, to opt out of the monitoring test in the run, pass the `--no-monitoring` flag to the build step.

## Tests

### Serving (Root)
#####` - GET http://<application_url>/`

*Response*

- If successful, the application should respond with the string 'Hello World!'

This is the most basic integration test. The driver performs a GET request to the root endpoint at the deployed application's URL. It retrieves data from the application, and verifies it matches the expected output (the text ‘Hello World!’).


### Standard Logging
#####` - POST http://<application_url>/logging_standard`

*Request Body*

| Property Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| token | 16 character (8 byte) hexadecimal string (uppercase) | The token to write in Stackdriver logs. |
| level | string; alphabetic (uppercase) | String representing the severity of the log entry. |

*Response*

- If successful, the application should respond with the source that the logs were written to in Stackdriver, and a 200 response code.

This tests the runtime’s integration with Stackdriver Logging through the runtime's standard logging module. The driver will generate a token and a log level, and send this payload to the sample application via a POST request. Once the application receives the payload, it will log the token at the provided level through its standard logging module (e.g. [logging](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html) in Python). The application will then send back to the test driver the location in Stackdriver to which the log entry was written; this varies across runtimes. See the [Logging v2 API Docs](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/reference/v2/rest/v2/LogEntry) for details; as an example, integration with Python's standard logging module sends all logs to `projects/<project_id>/logs/appengine.googleapis.com%2Fstderr`, so the sample application will return back to the test driver `appengine.googleapis.com%2Fstderr`.

If the write succeeded, the test driver will wait a short period of time for the log entry to propagate through Stackdriver, then retrieve all log entries written to the provided log source in the previous 2 minutes and verify that the provided token/level pair appears in Stackdriver.


### Custom Logging
#####` - POST http://<application_url>/logging_custom`

*Request Body*

| Property Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| log_name      | string; 16 characters; alphabetic (upper/lower case) | The name of the log to write in Stackdriver. |
| token | 16 character (8 byte) hexadecimal string (uppercase) | The token to write in Stackdriver logs. |
| level | string; alphabetic (uppercase) | String representing the severity of the log entry. |

*Response*

- If successful, the application should respond with the source that the logs were written to in Stackdriver, and a 200 response code.

This tests the runtime’s integration with writing custom log entries to Stackdriver Logging through a client library, instead of using the runtime's standard logging module's integration with the Stackdriver logging API. The driver will generate a payload containing a log name, token, and level, and send this payload to the sample application via a POST request. Once the application receives the payload, it will write a log entry to Stackdriver with the provided name and token value, at the specified level. *This is commonly done by using a language-specific client library, such as [google-cloud-python](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-python), though the implementation is left up to the runtime maintainers.* The application will then signal back to the driver that either the log entry has been written successfully by providing it with the source to which the log entry was written, or that an error was encountered (causing the test to fail). If the write succeeded, the test driver will wait a short period of time for the log entry to propagate through Stackdriver, then retrieve all log entries written to that specified log name in the previous 2 minutes and verify that the provided token/level pair appears in Stackdriver.


### Monitoring
#####` - POST http://<application_url>/monitoring`

*Request Body*

| Property Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| name      | string; 16 characters; alphabetic (upper/lower case) | The name of the metric to write in Stackdriver; **always prefixed with ‘custom.googleapis.com/’**. |
| token | integer 64-bit | The metric value to write into Stackdriver. |

*Response*

- If successful, the application should respond with a 200 response code and the string ‘OK’.

The monitoring test confirms the runtime’s ability to write metrics to Stackdriver. The driver will first generate a request payload and send it to the sample application in the normal fashion (HTTP POST request). Once the application receives the payload, it will create a [Cloud Monitoring Client](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/google-cloud-python/blob/master/monitoring/google/cloud/monitoring/client.py), and use this client to either retrieve the metric descriptor corresponding to the provided name, or create a new metric descriptor with this name (see the [Stackdriver Custom Metric Documentation](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/custom-metrics/creating-metrics) for more information on this). Once the metric descriptor is retrieved, the client will use this descriptor and the provided payload to write a custom metric to Stackdriver, and signal back to the driver that either the metric was written successfully, or that an error was encountered (causing the test to fail). If the write succeeded, the test driver will wait a short period of time for the metric entry to propagate through Stackdriver, then retrieve all metric entries with the specified name, and verify that the provided token exists as one of the values in that query.


### Error Reporting/Exceptions
#####` - POST http://<application_url>/exception`

*Request Body*

| Property Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| token | integer 64-bit | The metric value to write into Stackdriver. |

*Response*

- If successful, the application should respond with a 200 response code and the string ‘OK’.

This tests the runtime’s ability to report errors to Stackdriver. The driver will generate a request payload and POST it to the sample application. Upon receiving the payload, the application will create a Cloud Error Reporting Client. It will then use this client to report a generic exception. Additionally, it will use the client to report an exception with the provided token. Finally, it will report back to the test driver indicating that the exceptions were recorded successfully, or that an error was encountered, failing the test.

At this time, there is no support within the google-cloud-python client library for reading exceptions from Stackdriver, though the public API exists. It is potentially planned to add support within this client library to do this, enabling the test driver to actually verify the specific exception was recorded in Stackdriver successfully.
